# An Discord bot API plugin for Pocketmine-MP.

## Have you ever thought to yourself "I wish there was discord bot API plugins like Java Discord APIS"? Well, now you can!

## NOTE
This plugin is not made by me. The reason why I'm posting it on my own github is so I can make bug fixes and make the API as custom as possible. 

If you have found any bugs with this version, please be sure to open a new issue.
